As you might have noticed, there were no posts for a month. 

I didn't give up on my blogging challenge, just got really sick. This was probably the most
I've ever been sick in my life.

Almost as soon as I was discharged by doctors I went on business trip to my favourite city - London.

Now I'm finally back and hopefully ready to carry on. So I'll continue to publish new posts every week.

I'm pretty sure that the main reason I got sick was stress as I was both physically (had way too intensive workout few days before)
and emotionally (flower delivery services that were supposed to deliver flowers to my mother and grandmother on 8th March screwed me over 
and I spent almost entire day being very angry and trying to resolve the mess) exhausted.

So I decided that I need to work on my stress handling abilities ASAP and signed up to [The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being/home/welcome) 
on Coursera. Let's see how it goes.
